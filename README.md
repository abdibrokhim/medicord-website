# CoMed

CoMed is an AI platform transforming Brain MRI diagnostics to be easier, faster, and more accessible, especially in underserved rural areas. By integrating advanced AI into hospital workflows, we boost diagnostic accuracy from 84% to 95% and reduce waiting times from days to 15‚Äì30 minutes. Targeting hospitals and clinics lacking advanced diagnostics and radiologists, we aim to bridge critical healthcare gaps.

We provide affordable AI tools at $220‚ÄØper month, enhancing accuracy, & reducing wait times. Our long-term goal is to make advanced diagnostics universally accessible, fostering a global healthcare ecosystem that empowers medical professionals and patients alike.

We've developed a functional prototype, secured contracts with over 1,400 hospitals, accessed 3 million medical records for AI training. Received support from Amazon ($10,000), Microsoft ($150,000), and OpenAI ($2,500).
